## Introduction

Fraud detection is a critical challenge in financial institutions as fraudulent transactions can lead to significant financial losses and damage to the trust between banks and their customers. This project aims to develop a robust and scalable model to detect fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns in transaction data. The solution is designed to be both accurate and efficient, suitable for real-time applications in the banking sector.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was provided by the Innotech AI Competition and contains a large number of bank transaction records, including both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The data includes features such as transaction amount, transaction time, account age, and more.

- **Dataset Source:** Provided by Innotech AI Competition.
- **Number of Transactions:** [Specify the number of records].
- **Number of Features:** [Specify the number of features].

## Methodology

The approach to fraud detection in this project involves several key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
    - Handling missing values.
    - Feature engineering to create meaningful features from raw data.
    - Data normalization and scaling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Visualizing the distribution of features.
    - Identifying correlations between features.
    - Detecting any anomalies in the data.

3. **Model Selection:**
    - Comparison of different machine learning models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
    - Use of cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness.
    - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**
    - Precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve were used to evaluate the model performance.
    - Special emphasis on minimizing false positives to avoid disrupting legitimate transactions.

## Model Architecture

The final model architecture was selected based on performance and interpretability. The architecture used in this project is a [describe model architecture, e.g., Random Forest with 100 estimators, or a Neural Network with specific layers and activation functions]. The model includes features like [mention key features used in the model].

- **Model Type:** [Specify the model used, e.g., Random Forest, Neural Network]
- **Hyperparameters:** [List key hyperparameters]
- **Training Time:** [Provide training time, if relevant]

## Results

The model was evaluated using the test set provided by the competition, and it achieved the following results:

- **Accuracy:** [Specify accuracy]
- **Precision:** [Specify precision]
- **Recall:** [Specify recall]
- **F1-Score:** [Specify F1-score]
- **AUC-ROC:** [Specify AUC-ROC score]
